# EPUB Utilities

A collection of highly-customized (read: not generalized) utilties for dealing with EPUB3 generation.

## Utilities

Included utilities are:

* **transformer.php**: This script reads a directory of a Calibre-genenerated EPUB file (unzipped, of course) and converts it to a format to match my own EPUB structure. Things like `<p>Stats</p>` get turned into `<h3 class="stats-header">Stats</h3>` and the stats themselves go from `<p>25 Minutes</p>` to `<li class="stats">`. Additionally, a new style sheet is moved into place and image assets are given new names.
* **packager.php**: This script combines an OPF template with the output files generated by `transformer.php` and creates a new `package.opf` file. It builds out the `<manifest>` and `<spine>` sections, which could be difficult to manage manaully with hundreds of recipes.
* **renamer.php**: This script [not written at the time of this commit] renames the list of Calibre-generated chapter files so that they sort numerically. That is, files like 1, 2, 34, and 101 will be renamed to 0001, 0002, 0034, 0101 respectively.
