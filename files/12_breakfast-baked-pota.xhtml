<p class="no-indent">I routinely meal prep baked potatoes on the weekends for use throughout the week. It&#x2019;s great to just have them on hand for any potato need that may come up.</p>
<p>Like and such as this breakfast dish! If you meal prep your spuds, then this breakfast baked potato is ready in about 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Stats</p>
<p>85 Minutes</p>
<p>1 Serving</p>
<p>Ingredients</p>
<p>1 potato (about 8 ounces)</p>
<p>1 teaspoon grapeseed oil</p>
<p>1/4 teaspoon salt</p>
<p>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</p>
<p>1/2 cup fresh spinach</p>
<p>&#xbc; cup mushrooms, sauteed</p>
<p>1 slice of bacon, cooked and crumbled</p>
<p>1-ounce shredded cheddar cheese</p>
<p>1 egg</p>
<p>Method</p>
<p>Heat oven to 400 degrees.</p>
<p>Rub the potatoes with grapeseed oil, salt, and pepper. Bake for 1 hour.</p>
<p>Let cool and store in the fridge. This step can be done days in advance.</p>
<p>When it comes time to make the breakfast baked potatoes, slice the top of the potato open, and scoop out most of the potato pulp. Save it to make mashed potatoes or mashed potato cakes.</p>
<p>Layer the bottom of the potato with veggies of choice. Crack one egg into each baked potato; season with a bit of salt and pepper.</p>
<p>Bake for 15 minutes at 350 degrees.</p>
<p>While still in the oven, add the shredded cheese and bacon. Bake for an additional 5 minutes until the cheese is melted.</p>
