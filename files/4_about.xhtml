<p class="no-indent">Hi, I&#x2019;m Biz Velatini, author and recipe developer of MyBizzyKitchen.com.</p>
<p>While my recipes are written for Weight Watchers members, they are really for anyone. I use simple and delicious ingredients that are readily available, so that you can get Bizzy in your kitchen too.</p>
<p>I am born and raised in Chicago, became a widow in 2014 and have two amazing grown up children &#x2013; my daughter Hannah and stepson Joe, both of whom are happily married, and I love their spouses as if they were my own.</p>
<p>&#x2014; Biz</p>
